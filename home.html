                <h3>Bio Sortify : AI for greener tomorrow</h3>
                <p>I worked in a team during Philly Codefest 2024 to build an innovative project that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to revolutionize waste management. The AI model was trained on Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable image datasets that included over 250 thousand images, achieving over 98.8% of accuracy.</p>
